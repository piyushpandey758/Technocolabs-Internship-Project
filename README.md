# Mini Project

Developed a model that can differentiate healthy people from people having parkinson's disease.
Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. it leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination.The condition becomes worse and doesn't have a cure. Medications can only improve the condition but never cure the disease from the root.It often start with a slight tremor in one hand and a feeling of stiffness in the body. Over time, other symptoms develop, and some people will also have dementia. Most of the symptoms result from a fall in dopamine levels in the brain. We can only measure the level of the disease. By using the biomedical voice measurements of people with Parkisnson's disease, we can differentiate people with parkisnson's from normal people. Also, measure the level on the disease.
